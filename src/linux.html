    <h1>Arch Linux</h1>
    (wow that's hard, I should have tried Manjaro first)
    Booting up from the USB installer just left me at a blinking root prompt... I was like "is this even working?"
    I expected a guided installer just like every other distro ever.

    <h1>Ubuntu</h1>
    Since 8.04 but now it annoys me

    <h1>Other</h1>
    Other non-Linux OS I've tried:

    - Haiku OS crashed all the time

    Still thinking of trying Serenity OS https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity
