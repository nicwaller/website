    Why be vegan?

    <ul>
        <li>Animals are poorly treated, and then they're killed.</li>
        <li>On a global basis, animal farming is a major contributor to climate change.
        Though admittedly, that's only because so many people aren't driving cars yet.</li>
    </ul>

    Is it safe to be vegan?

    <ul>
        <li>Yes, a diet can be nutritionally adequate with or without consuming meat and other animal products.</li>
    </ul>
