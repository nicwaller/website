    <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>

    <p>
        Planning my <a href="https://www.theknot.com/us/shawna-smith-and-nicholas-waller-dec-2021">wedding</a>! I am recently engaged to the love of my life. ðŸ¥°
    </p>

    <p>
        I help with content moderation on the
        <a href="https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/">Sustainable Living Stack Exchange</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also making yet another attempt at a
        <a href="https://nicwaller.com/">personal homepage</a> on the world wide web.
        It's not new territory, but it feels more necessary now than ever before, since so
        much of the web has been consolidated into monolithic mega-sites.
