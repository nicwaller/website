    <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>

    <p>
        Planning my <a href="https://www.theknot.com/us/shawna-smith-and-nicholas-waller-dec-2021">wedding</a>! I am recently engaged to the love of my life. ðŸ¥°
    </p>

    <p>
        Beta-testing a very promising Gmail client for macOS:
        <a href="https://mimestream.com">Mimestream</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aching for places to share and learn from other technologists. So basically conferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        Exploring self-hosting and the Fediverse. I set up a Matrix Synapse server
        and Element web-based chat client. And <a href="https://cloudron.io">Cloudron.io</a>
        is pretty cool if you're interested in self-hosting but avoiding a lot of the work.
        Mattermost is a total clone of Slack in both form and function.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pantone chips! Because Shawna is studying colour theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working with a personal trainer to get stronk (virtual sessions only -- be COVID-safe!)
    </p>

    <p>
        Encouraging people to use <a href="https://signal.org/en/download/">Signal</a> instead of other worse messengers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Revelling in the speed of the new M1 MacBook Pro. ðŸš€
        (Still not quite ready for web dev at work though.)
    </p>

    <p>
        I help with content moderation on the
        <a href="https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/">Sustainable Living Stack Exchange</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also making yet another attempt at a
        <a href="https://nicwaller.com/">personal homepage</a> on the world wide web.
        It's not new territory, but it feels more necessary now than ever before, since so
        much of the web has been consolidated into monolithic mega-sites.
