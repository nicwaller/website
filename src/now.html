    <h1>What am I doing now?</h1>

    <p>
        I'm building a website called <a href="https://random.surf">Random.Surf</a> that shows
        random webpages from around the world wide web. No content is shown twice; every
        visit is unique. Escape your filter bubble and explore the deep web.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the first year that I've had a successful garden.
        I've always thought that gardening is something any good <a href="vegan.html">vegan</a>
        should be able to do. The radishes are growing well.
    </p>

    <p>
        I help with content moderation on the
        <a href="https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/">Sustainable Living Stack Exchange</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm also making yet another attempt at a
        <a href="https://nicwaller.com/">personal homepage</a> on the world wide web.
        It's not new territory, but it feels more necessary now than ever before, since so
        much of the web has been consolidated into monolithic mega-sites.
