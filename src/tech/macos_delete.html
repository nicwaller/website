    <h1>Case Study: delete confirmation in macOS</h1>

    <p>
        Since the earliest days of Macintosh OS
        (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/apple-os-x-dead-long-live-macos/">now macOS</a>)
        Apple has placed emphasis on presenting users with a consistent interface and experience.
        The authoritative reference for designing consistent applications is the
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)</a>
        published by Apple.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page is a case study of one function that is common to many applications: deleting items or records.
        I will test the behaviour of various applications included with macOS and then classify them into categories.
        When I observe strange behaviours, I will add notes.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Well-Behaved and Fluid</h2>
        <p>
            The ideal user experience is created when the application supports the user in being safe,
            while also reducing friction by getting out of the way as much as possible. This ideal is exemplified
            by applications that delete items immediately without a prompt, while also making it easy to undo accidental deletions.
            All of the following applications fit this behaviour:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Keynote (delete slide)</li>
            <li>Calendar (delete event)</li>
            <li>Finder (delete file)</li>
            <li>Mail (delete message)</li>
            <li>Voice Memos (delete memo)</li>
            <li>Notes (delete note)</li>
            <li>Preview (delete page)</li>
            <li>Reminders (delete reminder)</li>
            <li>Safari (delete bookmark or bookmark folder)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Well-Behaved, but Mildly Annoying</h2>
        <p>
            Some applications add unnecessary friction to the process by displaying a modal sheet to confirm deletion.
            Well-behaved applications will use the same keyboard shortcuts to confirm or block the delete action.
            Applications should ideally still support undo, but may instead present warning text that the operation cannot be undone.
            A modal sheet provides helpful delay when thinking about irreversible operations.
        </p>

        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Application</th>

                <td>Delete</td>

    <section>
        <h2>No Undo History</h2>
        <p>
            Deletions in these applications cannot be un-done.
            The modal sheet should provide guidance that undo is not possible,
            but unfortunately it is not mentioned.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>News (unfollow a source)</li>
            <li>Keychain Access (delete an item)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Inconsistent key bindings</h2>
        <p>
            Each of these applications deviates from the normal keybindings in some way.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Messages (delete a conversation). The return key is bound to cancel (instead of delete).
                The only keybinding to confirm deletion is Cmd-D, which is not used anywhere else.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stocks (delete stock). Return doesn't confirm deletion. Undo is unavailable, but not mentioned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Home (delete a scene). Scenes cannot be selected with the keyboard.
                Deletion cannot be initiated with the keyboard.
                The confirmation prompt cannot be accepted or dismissed by the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Podcasts (remove a podcast)
                There is no keybinding that will confirm deletion.
                The return key is bound to cancel instead of delete.
                The operation cannot be undone, and there is no warning about permanence.
                All other keyboard events fall through the modal -- for example, pressing
                the spacebar toggles the play/pause behaviour of the podcast in the parent window.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Notes (delete a folder).
                The items in the folder are not put back into the folder when the folder is restored.
                Also, Notes crashed 10 seconds after restoring a deleted item.
            </li>
        </ul>
