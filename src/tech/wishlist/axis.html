    <h1>AXIS IP webview</h1>

    AXIS IP cameras record video to local storage, which is hard to access remotely.
    They can send still images over HTTP, but those are hard to work with.
    Imagine if there was a cool HTTP endpoint that could receive images from an AXIS
    IP camera and group them into sequences and render them into video or animated
    GIFs and identify the interesting keyframes and then trigger Slack integrations
    or whatever else.
