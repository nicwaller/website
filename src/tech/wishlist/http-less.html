    <h1><code>less</code></h1>

    Less, for large HTTP-addressable objects (including AWS S3)
    Progressive loading and viewing of very large files
    And progressive listing of very large directories.
    Text, multiple encodings, mine type, and hex viewer

    Would be awesome to distribute as a single binary, maybe compiled from Rust.
