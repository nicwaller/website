    <h1>Sharegeo</h1>

    Just a simple website that allows you to share your location with other people.
    Either one quick share, or for a longer period of time. Like activities of a couple
    hours up to a day, semi-realtime sharing of location. So you could have like a group
    bike ride and see where everyone is. Or even longer-term recording, so you can record
    your trip through countries and so on. And then provide people with their own GPX
    if they want it. And also use end-to-end encryption to implement a zero-trust solution
    that makes it impossible for the server to see the actual location data that is being
    sent between clients.

    This is related to my other idea for an Open GPX tracker:
    A Strava-like fitness tracking app that sends your GPX to a custom webhook or email address.

    Also related to my other GPS idea:
    I want to map out how good/bad my cell service is along the skytrain route, and
    use that to go hassle my cell phone provider. (Except it turns out that GPS inside tunnels
    is also unreliable... so probably a lot of data massage needed.)
