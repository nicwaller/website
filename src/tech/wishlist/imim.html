    <h1>IMAP Instant Messenger</h1>

    One of the worst things about email is signatures and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salutation">salutations</a>.
    Another terrible thing is HTML content obscuring the actual message.
    Maybe we should strip email back to the bare minimum, make it real-time,
    and use it as a protocol for instant messaging. Of course, it would be
    backward compatible with email so you can still communicate with everyone
    you need to reach. But maybe some additional features are available when
    both sides are using IMAP Instant Messenger (IMIM). This would also fix
    the problem of the conversation not appearing linearly, partly due to
    the messed-up way that people format replies which is exacerbated by
    signatures and salutations.
