    <h1>IMAP Agent</h1>
    What good is an email client that doesn't help you read any email?
    When I was listening to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/539">Mac Power
    Users #539 - Back to Email</a> I started thinking it might be super useful
    to have a stripped down IMAP client where the sole purpose is executing
    rules (filtering, etc.). Sure, Gmail gives you the ability to perform some
    basic filtering, but you can't do any complex operations. You can't even
    unconditionally forward email! Imagine having much more power, extensible
    with local programming and shell scripts. Being able to run it in AWS ECS
    or Lambda would be one thing, but running it locally at home could allow
    even cooler "smart home" interactions based on email. And for IMAP servers
    that don't have great rules processing, you can kind of add that function.
    Perhaps this could even be used to act as an "agent" of the user, automating
    and performing more complex actions that users might take.
