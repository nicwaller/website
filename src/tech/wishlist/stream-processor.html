    <h1>Stream Management System</h1>
    An event filtering platform
    Like strapi but for information flow instead of static content
    Receive from RabbitMQ or SQS or EventBridge
    How does this compare to that tool for HL7 events?
    Visual programming?
    Tests and filtering
    Forward events to slack, pagerduty, email, elastic search, SNS, SQS
    How compare to IFTTT?
    Like log stash on steroids
    Event fan-out pipelines
    Back pressure and high volume?
    How compare to Riemann?
    Like a CMS... but for real-time data
    Logs
    And business events
    Integration with Jira? Create issues, or react to issues
    How to avoid short circuits?? Or at least slow them down.
    Self hosted so you can easily add your own code
    Or cloud hosted to get started easily
    React to events from slack like messages or reactions
    What about enqueueing future events? Like notify 3 months after hiring? Is this some kind of plugin? How does it relate to deferred work?
    Real-time first. Visit a page to see real time event stream.
    Auth0 events
    Event source dashboard
    Kinesis underneath? Or as an input? Event replay? What does downtime look like? What is the HA model?
    Stream processing
    Duplicate event detection? Deduication?
    Time dimension? Or just do everything in the moment without temporal context? Create "basins" that collect statistics on events matching a certain user defined pattern. Create metrics on all numerical values.
    Streaming SQL
    Sounds like WSO2
