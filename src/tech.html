    A bunch of tech things I have my eye on.

    <a href="https://deno.land/v1">Deno</a> - Run JavaScript more securely than with Node.js.

    <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> and Apache Flight - Unify data structures across computer architectures. Avoid serialization penalty.

    Parquet - columnar data formats are pretty smart

    <a href="https://github.com/Jeffail/benthos/blob/master/README.md">Benthos</a> - I am always looking for better tools for processing streaming events. Logstash is powerful and flexible, but it's also a complete dog for performance. Also have my eye on Apache Storm, Flink, Wallaroo, and Mozilla Heka.

    Common Crawl project.

    Kite - https://kite.com/

    <a href="https://github.com/smallstep/certificates">
        Smallstep - Private x.509 certificate authority
    </a>

    <a href="https://nsq.io">NSQ</a> - Realtime distributed messaging

    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23042424">Gemini</a> - a modernized gopher-like protocol
    see also: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23257543">where have all the gophers gone</a>
