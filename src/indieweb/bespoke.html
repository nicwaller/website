    Bespoke software is software for small groups. Not "internet scale".

    If you are publishing and distributing through a commercial App Store than it probably is not bespoke software

    If you haven't met the people using the software it's probably not bespoke software. If you don't know them already and share their need.

    It's OK to make software for yourself only. You don't have to distribute it.
